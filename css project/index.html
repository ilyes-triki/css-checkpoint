              StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty features the return of the three
              species from the original game: Protoss, Terran, and Zerg. In the
              Terran campaign, the original StarCraft briefing room is replaced
              with an interactive version of the battlecruiser Hyperion, with
              Jim Raynor, a bitter and hard-drinking mercenary captain, as the
              central character. In a departure from previous Blizzard games,
              the campaign is non-linear, with Raynor taking jobs for money and
              using that money to buy additional units and upgrades. Although
              each play through will vary, the end result remains consistent,
              keeping the storyline linear. Blizzard's Vice President Rob Pardo
              stressed that each campaign will function very differently. The
              Terran campaign, Wings of Liberty, places players in a
              mercenary-style campaign, as Terran rebel group Raynor's Raiders
              raise funds by taking assignments from outside groups. The second
              release, Heart of the Swarm, is Zerg-focused and has role-playing
              elements. Sarah Kerrigan is the focus of the campaign, and the
              story revolves around the possibility of her redemption. The
              Protoss-themed Legacy of the Void is the thired expansion, with
              the Protoss Artanis attempting to reunite the Protoss tribes in
              order to stop Amon, a fallen Xel'Naga. Wings of Liberty has 29
              playable campaign missions; 26 are playable in a single
              playthrough, three missions are choice-related alternates. The
              Wings of Liberty campaign contains several missions with unique
              features, such as lava that floods the battlefield every five
              minutes, forcing the player to move their units to high ground
              before they are destroyed. In another mission, enemy units attack
              the player only at night, forcing the player into a form of siege
              warfare. In one mission, the player must use a single unit to
              influence the tide of an AI-controlled battle. Between missions,
              players can choose units, buildings, and upgrades that are not
              available in the multiplayer missions. Wings of Liberty features
              approximately the same number of units as the original
              StarCraft.Some units from the original game have returned, some
              featuring new upgrades and abilities. For example, the Protoss
              Zealot, a melee unit from the original game, has the researchable
              ability to dash forward and quickly reach nearby enemies as a
              refinement of its speed upgrade from the original. Other units
              have been replaced or removed. Other changes to unit design have
              been inspired by story events in StarCraft and its expansion
              StarCraft: Brood War, replacing old units with new or renamed
              versions which sport different attributes and abilities.Units in
              StarCraft II have new abilities, compared to the original, that
              encourage more complex interaction with the game environment.
              Among these are the inclusion of units that can traverse varying
              levels of terrain, or have the ability to teleport short
              distances. Some Protoss units can be warped into pylon-powered
              areas using the Warp Gate, a slight modification of an existing
              building called the Gateway. StarCraft II's campaign has units
              that are only playable in the campaign and not in the regular
              multiplayer mode, though they are available for custom maps. These
              mostly consist of units that have been scrapped from development
              such as the Terran Diamondback as well as various returning units
              from the original StarCraft such as the Terran Wraith and Goliath.
              The campaign features hirable mercenaries, modified versions of
              certain units with enhanced attributes such as health or damage
              that become available for hire once the standard unit is unlocked.

              Separated from the Swarm, a lone zergling must fight to overcome
              his own nature to defeat his sinister captors. Check out this
              excerpt, then download Operation Blind Devil by Cassandra Clarke,
              the final entry in a new series of StarCraft II short stories to
              celebrate the game's 10th anniversary. He moves cautiously, claws
              clicking against the shiny floor. It’s cold on his feet, smooth.
              Strange. It does not feel alive. It’s not spongy or warm, like the
              tissue of the leviathan in which he lives. He walks in a circle,
              listening to the click click click. If he goes fast enough, the
              clicks seem to multiply as if he’s out where he’s supposed to be,
              following the Queen of Blades across the nerve center of her
              leviathan. Did his footsteps sound like hers would? He knows she
              isn’t dead. He can feel her where she’s supposed to be: a constant
              whisper in the back of his thoughts, a running reassurance that he
              is not alone, even when he is alone. Other zerglings slide across
              the walls of this strange round room, following him around and
              around. He walks, click, click, click. But aside from his
              footsteps, there is just emptiness. A strange and hollow thing.
              The other zerglings are still behind him and he’s angry that he
              has been trapped here with them so he whirls around and snarls and
              charges. But he doesn’t hit a zergling! He hits a wall that, like
              the floor, is smooth and shiny. He shakes his head. Growls again.
              The wall zergling does the same, and he thinks he must have
              injured it somehow; one of its horns is missing its sharp point.
              He scrapes his claws on the floor. The wall zergling does too. He
              crouches. So does the wall zergling. He moves closer to the wall.
              He feels something snap inside his head. It’s like when the Queen
              of Blades issues a command, and he feels himself turning on,
              knowing what to do, where to go. Understanding. He understands
              something. That zergling on the wall? It’s him. He’s never seen
              himself before. He’s pleased that he looks so much like the rest
              of his brood: a part of a whole, even though there is no whole in
              this place. He is alone.
